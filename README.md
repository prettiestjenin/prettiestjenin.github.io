> Hi! I'm Iriz and here is a short compilation of my top 5 favorite songs at the moment. I hope that through this compilation you may also grow appreciation to the following songs.

 **Ever since I was a young girl I have always been facinated by music, music wasn't just simple songs for me it was a cause of my joy and a better way of how I understood myself, my life, and the people around me. Relating to songs helps us know that we aren't the only ones going through endless struggles, experiencing heartbreaks, being in love and in short living. Music is an outlet for all of us to inspire and be inspired.**
